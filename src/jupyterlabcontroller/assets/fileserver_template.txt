Your <a href="{base_url}/files/{username}">fileserver</a> is ready.

<h1>
Access Token
</h1>

If you do not have an access token, go to <a
href="https://data-dev.lsst.cloud/auth/tokens/">the Gafaelfawr tokens
page</a> and press the "Create Token" button.

Give that token a name, such as "fileserver", the "exec:notebook" scope,
and a reasonable expiration data, such as 1 month.

Press "Create".

Your token will be displayed.  Copy this token and save it somewhere
safe; you will never be able to view it from the tokens page again.

<h1>
Using the Fileserver
</h1>

To use the fileserver, point the WebDAV client of your choice.  Mac and
Windows have built-in WebDAV clients, as do Gnome Nautilus and Konqueror
for Linux.  The open-source command-line client <a
href="https://github.com/notroj/cadaver>cadaver</a> should build on
almost any Unix-like system and will work as well.

Connect to <a
href="{base_url}/files/{username}">{base_url}/files/{username}</a> with
your WebDAV client (for Konqueror, use "webdavs" rather than "https" as
your protocol).  Use the token you acquired earlier as the password.
You can use any string for your username (since the token belongs to
you, it identifies you), but your username is both accurate and
traditional.

If you make no requests in {timeout} seconds, the fileserver will shut
down.  If that occurs, simply go back to "{base_url}/files"
and a new fileserver will be created for you.
