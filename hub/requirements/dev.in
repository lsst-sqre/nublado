# Editable development dependencies for the JupyterHub Docker image. Add
# direct development, test, and documentation dependencies here, as well as
# implicit dev dependencies with constrained versions. This must include all
# of the development dependencies of the authenticator and spawner modules.

# After editing, update hub/requirements/dev.txt by running:
#     nox -s update-deps

# Type checking. The top-level pyproject.toml configures the Pydantic mypy
# plugin, so pydantic has to be installed for mypy to run. We don't use
# Pydantic ourselves in the JupyterHub plugin modules.

# These dependencies aren't required in Python 3.11 or later but are required
# in 3.10. Pin them so that we can regenerate dependencies with Python 3.11
# and still successfully test using Python 3.10, which the base JupyterHub
# image currently uses.
