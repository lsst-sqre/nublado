# Zero-to-JupyterHub unconditionally imports this, so we have to have it

# These dependencies aren't required in Python 3.11 or later but are required
# in 3.10. Pin them so that we can regenerate dependencies with Python 3.11
# and still successfully build a Docker image using Python 3.10, which the
# base JupyterHub image currently uses.

# This one seems to be a dependency on amd64 but not arm64, so developing on
# Mac without it looks fine locally but does not work on Github Actions
