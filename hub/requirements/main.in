# After editing, update hub/requirements/main.txt by running:

# We want to explicitly control new versions of JupyterHub. Pin this to the
# same version that Dockerfile uses -- but Dockerfile refers to the z2jh
# version, so, we have to determine what version is actually in the z2jh
# version and put that here.  If all else fails, bring up the z2jh container
# with /bin/sh as the command to run, and look at the `pip list` output.
