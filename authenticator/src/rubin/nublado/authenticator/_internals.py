class GafaelfawrAuthenticator(Authenticator):
    """JupyterHub authenticator using Gafaelfawr headers.

    Rather than implement any authentication logic inside of JupyterHub,
    authentication is done via an ``auth_request`` handler made by the NGINX
    ingress controller. JupyterHub then only needs to read the authentication
    results from the headers of the incoming request.

    Normally, the authentication flow for JupyterHub is to send the user to
    ``/hub/login`` and display a login form. The submitted values to the form
    are then passed to the ``authenticate`` method of the authenticator, which
    is responsible for returning authentication information for the user.
    That information is then stored in an authentication session and the user
    is redirected to whatever page they were trying to go to.

    We however do not want to display an interactive form, since the
    authentication information is already present in the headers. We just need
    JupyterHub to read it.

    The documented way to do this is to register a custom login handler on a
    new route not otherwise used by JupyterHub, and then enable the
    ``auto_login`` setting on the configured authenticator. This setting tells
    the built-in login page to, instead of presenting a login form, redirect
    the user to whatever URL is returned by ``login_url``. In our case, this
    will be ``/hub/gafaelfawr/login``. This simple handler will read the token
    from the header, retrieve its metadata, create the session and cookie, and
    then make the same redirect call the login form handler would normally
    have made after the ``authenticate`` method returned.

    In this model, the ``authenticate`` method is not used, since the login
    handler never receives a form submission.

    Notes
    -----
    A possible alternative implementation that seems to be supported by the
    JupyterHub code would be to not override ``login_url``, set
    ``auto_login``, and then override ``get_authenticated_user`` in the
    authenticator to read authentication information directly from the request
    headers. It looks like an authenticator configured in that way would
    authenticate the user "in place" in the handler of whatever page the user
    first went to, without any redirects. This would be slightly more
    efficient and the code appears to handle it, but the current documentation
    (as of 1.5.0) explicitly says to not override ``get_authenticated_user``.

    This implementation therefore takes the well-documented path of a new
    handler and a redirect from the built-in login handler, on the theory that
    a few extra redirects is a small price to pay for staying within the
    supported and expected interface.
