A Nublado administrator is someone who is responsible for configuring Nublado as part of a Rubin Science Platform deployment.
That work is primarily done in Phalanx_.

This documentation provides the reference manual for Nublado, including all of the available options in the Helm chart.
Guides to common problems and instructions on how to integrate properly with Phalanx environments, such as for managing secrets, are found in the Phalanx documentation, specifically the `Nublado Phalanx application`_, and the general `Phalanx documentation for developers <https://phalanx.lsst.io/developers/index.html>`__.
