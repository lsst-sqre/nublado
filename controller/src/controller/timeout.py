    Many Nublado controller operations involve operations that support
    individual timeouts, where all operations must complete within a total
    timeout. Examples include spawning a lab or creating a user file server.
    This class encapsulates that type of timeout and provides methods to
    retrieve timeouts for individual operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    operation
        Human-readable name of operation, for error reporting.
    timeout
        Duration of the timeout.
    user
        If given, user associated with the timeout, for error reporting.
