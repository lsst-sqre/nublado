Your fileserver is ready.

<h2>
Access Token
</h2>

<p> If you do not have an access token, go to <a
href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth/tokens">the Gafaelfawr tokens page</a> and press
the "Create Token" button.  </p>

<p>
Give that token a name, such as "fileserver", the "exec:notebook" scope,
and a reasonable expiration duration, such as 1 month.
</p>

<p>
Press "Create".
</p>

<p>
Your token will be displayed.  Copy this token and save it somewhere
safe; you will never be able to view it from the tokens page again.
</p>

<h2>
Using the Fileserver
</h2>

<p>
To use the fileserver, you will need a WebDAV client of your choice.
Mac and Windows have built-in WebDAV clients (this is "Connect to
Server..." or "Map Network Drive..."), as do Gnome Nautilus and
Konqueror for Linux.  The open-source command-line client
<a href="https://github.com/notroj/cadaver">cadaver</a> should build on
almost any Unix-like system and will work.
</p>

<p>
Connect to
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/files/rachel">http://127.0.0.1:8080/files/rachel</a>
with your WebDAV client (for Konqueror, use "webdav" or "webdavs" rather
than "http" or "https" as the protocol).  Use the token you acquired
earlier as the password.  You can use any string for your username
(since the token belongs to you, it identifies you), but "rachel"
would be both accurate and traditional.
</p>

<p>
If you make no requests in 1h, the fileserver will shut
down.  If that occurs, simply go back to
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/files">http://127.0.0.1:8080/files</a>
and a new fileserver will be created for you.
