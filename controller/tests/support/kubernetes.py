    We often want to compare the contents of the mock Kubernetes with the

    ----------

        List of objects to serialize, which may include custom objects that
        are represented by raw dicts.

    Returns
    -------
    list of dict
        List of serialized objects with `None` elements removed, suitable
        for comparison.
