### New features

- Add support for per-user subdomains to the Nublado client. If they are enabled, they will be automatically detected and the Nublado client will adjust its HTTP requests accordingly.
- Add support to the Nublado client testing mocks for simulating per-user subdomains.

### Bug fixes

- Set `Sec-Fetch-Mode` in several places in the Nublado client to suppress harmless but annoying warnings in the JupyterHub logs.
