### Bug fixes

- Support pagination when listing the tags for lab images from a Docker repository in the Nublado controller. This is required when using GitHub Container Registry as an image source if there are a significant number of image tags.

- Send the correct `Accept` header when requesting container checksums from a Docker registry that may contain multi-architecture images.
