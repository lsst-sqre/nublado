### Backwards-incompatible changes

Jupyterhub 4.1.0 has much tighter XSRF handling than previous versions.
If this is installed, anything that talks to Jupyterhub (e.g. mobu and
noteburst) will have to handle XSRF the same way that the JupyterLab
Javascript client does.

### New features

Update to Jupyterhub 4.1.0 and Zero To Jupyterhub 3.3.2.
