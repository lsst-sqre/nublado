### Bug fixes

- Do not query Kubernetes for pod status when responding to status requests, and instead assume the internal state (which is reconciled periodically) is correct. The constant Kubernetes API requests for `Pod` status seemed to be overwhelming the control plane when there were a lot of pods running. Continue to ask Kubernetes directly immediately before spawn.
