### Bug fixes

- Simplify the HTML page shown after the user spawns a file server and point to the RSP documentation.
- Standardize on `write:files` as the scope for accessing the file server. This was already required to spawn the file server, but `exec:notebook` was still used to control access to the spawned file server.
