### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Added Nublado controller route to control administrative filesystem pod.
    This allows a user with an admin token to spawn a pod that mounts user file systems with administrative privileges.
	That pod can then be entered by the administrator with `kubectl exec` for remedial or forensic purposes.
	The pod can also be deleted through this route, and the status of the pod can be queried.
