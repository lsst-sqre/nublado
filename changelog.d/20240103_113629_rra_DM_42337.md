### Bug fixes

- Restrict access to controller routes via the `admin:jupyterlab` scope to only those routes that JupyterHub needs to use. Access to other administrative routes is now controlled with `exec:admin`.
- Fix the response type for the `/spawner/v1/labs/{username}/events` route in the OpenAPI schema.
