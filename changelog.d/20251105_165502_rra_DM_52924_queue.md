### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Rename the client mock method to set the results of a notebook execution to `register_notebook_result`.
- Replace public attributes on the client mock with new methods `get_last_spawn_form`, `get_session`, `set_delete_delay`, `set_redirect_loop`, and `set_spawn_timeout`.
- Allow the result passed to `register_python_result` to be an exception, which is then raised and handled as a code failure.
- Remove special-case of the code block `long_error_for_test()` in the client mock.
