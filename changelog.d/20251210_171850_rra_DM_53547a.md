### New features

- Use [Repertoire](https://repertoire.lsst.io/) in the Nublado controller to find the Gafaelfawr API instead of assuming the URL structure of the local Phalanx environment.

### Bug fixes

- Stop imposing restrictions on usernames and group names in the Nublado controller apart from those already imposed by Gafaelfawr.
