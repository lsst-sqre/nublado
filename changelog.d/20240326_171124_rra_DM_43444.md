### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Move the admin route for deleting a user's file server from `/nublado/fileserver/v1/<username>` to `/nublado/fileserver/v1/users/<username>` to better align with other routes and REST semantics.

### New features

- Add an admin-authenticated `/nublado/fileserver/v1/users/<username>` GET route to get the status of a user's running file server (currently only 404 if not running or 200 with trivial content if running).
- Add a `/nublado/fileserver/v1/user-status` route a user to get the status of their own file server, which similarly returns 404 or 200 with trivial content.
