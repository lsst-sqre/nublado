### Bug fixes

- Fix a race condition during file server Kubernetes reconciliation where a file server in the process of being created, but waiting for the ingress to become valid, could be deleted by the background reconciliation job.
- Fix background task timing with very short intervals. This will probably never arise in a production configuration but was triggered by the test suite.
