### New features

- Resource requests for user lab pods can (and must) be specified explicitly.
  Before this change, only resource limits were specified and requests were calculated to be 1/4 of the limits.

  The `controller.config.lab.sizes` entries now have a different format.

  Old:

  ```yaml
  sizes:
    - size: "small"
      cpu: 1.0      # This was a limit
      memory: "4Gi" # This was a limit
  ```

  New:
  ```yaml
  sizes:
    - size: "small"
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 1.0
          memory: "4Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: 0.25
          memory: "0.75Gi"
  ```
