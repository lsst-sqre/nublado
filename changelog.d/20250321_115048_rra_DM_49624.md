### Bug fixes

- Add a configuration setting for where to redirect the user after logout from JupyterHub. When user subdomains are in use, this needs to point to `/logout` at the base URL for the Science Platform, not `/logout` at the current hostname, which may be the JupyterHub hostname and thus create an infinite redirect loop.
