### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Use the new Gafaelfawr client in the Nublado client mock to manage and verify tokens. Test suites that use the Jupyter mock from the Nublado client now must also mock Gafaelfawr and use the mock Gafaelfawr to generate a token and register corresponding user information before calling the Jupyter mock.
- Drop support for Python 3.12 in the Nublado client.
