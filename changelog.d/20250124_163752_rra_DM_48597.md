### Bug fixes

- Report Kubernetes operation timeouts properly when they cause a spawn failure rather than throwing an uncaught exception.
- If retrieving the user's lab `Pod` phase from Kubernetes times out, optimistically assume that the status recorded in memory is correct rather than throwing an uncaught exception. This matches the behavior for Kubernetes API failures.
