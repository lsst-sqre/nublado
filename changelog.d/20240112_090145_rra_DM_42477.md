### Bug fixes

- All user file servers are now protected by a `NetworkPolicy` that prevents connections except via Gafaelfawr, ensuring that authentication is properly enforced.

### Other changes

- Change the default namespace and Argo CD application for user file servers to `nublado-fileservers`.
