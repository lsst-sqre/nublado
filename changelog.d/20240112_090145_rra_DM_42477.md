### Bug fixes

- All user file servers are now protected by a `NetworkPolicy` that prevents connections except via Gafaelfawr, ensuring that authentication is properly enforced.

### Other changes

- Change the default Argo CD application for user file servers to `nublado-fileservers`. Continue to use `fileservers` as the default namespace, since the `nublado-fileservers` namespace would conflict with the reserved namespace pattern for user labs.
