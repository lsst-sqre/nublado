### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Delete `JupyterLabSession.run_notebook_via_rsp_extension` and replace it with `NubladoClient.run_notebook`, which uses the same extension but does not require creating a session first. The notebook content to execute must be passed in; providing a path relative to the user's Nublado home directory is not supported.
